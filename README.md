This container can be used as a remote discovery scan agent.

## How to use this Docker image

### Setup PHPIPAM

* Configure a remote agent (Administration > scan agents), get the key.
![config_agent](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4225738/45190599-0b799000-b23f-11e8-9e41-fb993606264d.png)

* For each subnet, enable scan & configure the remote agent by selecting a remote.

### Setup database

* Configure MySQL/MariaDB to [listen for incoming connections](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/configuring-mariadb-for-remote-client-access/) (not bind to loopback)

* Grant remote access to the database:
```
$ mysql -u root -p
> GRANT SELECT on `phpipam`.* TO 'username'@'192.168.1.%' identified by "securePasswordHere";
> GRANT INSERT on `phpipam`.* TO 'username'@'192.168.1.%' identified by "securePasswordHere";
> GRANT UPDATE on `phpipam`.* TO 'username'@'192.168.1.%' identified by "securePasswordHere";
> GRANT DELETE on `phpipam`.* TO 'username'@'192.168.1.%' identified by "securePasswordHere";
```
*Use `%` as a wildcard. `'phpipam'@'192.168.1.%'` would allow the user `phpipam` to access the database from any host on the `192.168.1.0/24` network. `'phpipam'@'%'` would let that user in from ANY host.*
